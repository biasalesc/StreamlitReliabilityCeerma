# Reliability App

This GitHub repository is the source code of the [Reliability App](https://reliabilityceerma.streamlit.app/), a website that implements the [Reliability](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package, extending its visualization and interpretation capabilities. All graphs are interactive and were built using Plotly.

## Use
The code was tested in Python 3.9. To install the required packages simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the App locally:
